# LLM-Based Chatbot for Domain-Specific Question Answering

## Overview
This project implements an AI-powered chatbot using a Large Language Model (LLM) to answer questions from a structured dataset. The project was completed as part of my MSc in Automation Control and Robotics.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and structuring for NLP tasks
- Prompt engineering to guide LLM responses
- Iterative testing and refinement of chatbot outputs
- Python-based implementation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- LLM API / framework
- GitHub for version control

## What I Learned
- Practical application of NLP concepts
- Importance of data quality in AI systems
- Prompt engineering and response evaluation techniques

## Status
Academic project – further improvements planned.
